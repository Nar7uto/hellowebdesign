# Design Courses

There are quite a few other design courses online teaching web design. Here are
some I've found (Note: most of these have been tested myself so I cannot
vouch for quality.)

**Skillshare ([https://www.skillshare.com/browse/design](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/design))**

This online course website has a wide-ranging selection of design videos and tutorials, from learning Adobe Illustrator, logo design, lettering, and more. The best online resource for design and visual tutorials.

**Theory Sprints ([http://studiofellow.com/theory-sprints/](http://studiofellow.com/theory-sprints/)) by Jarrod Drysdale**

Great online course to help designers become better designers. If youâ€™re looking to jump into a career in design, this is the online course for you.
